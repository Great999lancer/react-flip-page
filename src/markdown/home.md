React Flip Page aims at producing a Flipboard® -like effect with page flips.

Over the time it has acquired more features that you will discover in the docs or examples.

## Getting started

### Installing

First of all, you must install the React Flip Page package.
It is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flip-page),
but you can also use Yarn to install it.

```bash
yarn add react-flip-page
```

### Using

Then you should use a bundler of your choice (webpack, rollup…)
to add React Flip Page to your project.

You're now good to go! Here is a basic sample code to get you started:

```xml
<FlipPage>
  <img src="http://unsplash.it/320/480" />
  <img src="http://unsplash.it/320/480" />
</FlipPage>
```

This will show a component with two images so that you can try the effect inside of your project.

## What next?

You can learn a lot by just reading [the docs](./docs). These will help you customize the component
to your needs.

Also, if you feel like it, you can show your support by staring
[the repository](https://www.github.com/darenju/react-flip-page) on GitHub, or you can send
screenshots/URLs of your React Flip Page usage. Send them on Twitter to
